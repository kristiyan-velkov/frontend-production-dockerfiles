# Project rules for AI assistants (Cursor, VS Code, and others)

When editing Dockerfiles or Docker Compose files in this repo, follow the project standards so changes stay consistent with the rest of the codebase.

## Docker and Compose

- **Dockerfiles** (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.*`): Follow [docs/DOCKERFILE_STANDARDS.md](docs/DOCKERFILE_STANDARDS.md). Use multi-stage builds, ARG for versions, COPY --link, non-root USER (nginx or node), and the same structure as in react.js, vue.js, angular, next.js, nuxt.js, remix.js, analog.js, and tanstack-start.
- **Compose** (`compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`): Follow [docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_STANDARDS.md](docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_STANDARDS.md). Use kebab-case service names, build.args (NODE_VERSION, NGINX_VERSION, APP_NAME where needed), image/container_name suffix convention, restart: unless-stopped, and the same port/env patterns as in existing compose files.

Apply these standards in Cursor, VS Code, or any other editor/AI that has access to this repo.
