# IMPORTANT: Node.js and Nginxinc Image Version Maintenance
# This Dockerfile uses Node.js 24.11.1-slim and Nginxinc image with alpine3.22, which was the latest LTS version at the time of writing.
# To ensure security and compatibility, regularly validate and update the NODE_VERSION ARG and NGINXINC_IMAGE_TAG to the latest LTS versions.

ARG NODE_VERSION=24.11.1-slim
