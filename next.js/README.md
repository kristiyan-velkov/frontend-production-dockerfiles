## Security

This Docker image has been thoroughly scanned for vulnerabilities to ensure a secure environment for your Next.js 15 application. The image has passed all vulnerability assessments using Docker's built-in security tools, including Docker Scout. Regular updates to the base image and dependencies are recommended to maintain a high level of security.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your machine.
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) installed to use the Task commands.

_or if you prefer Make_:

- [Make](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)>) installed to use the Makefile commands.

### Environment Variables

The following variables are defined in the `Taskfile` and `Makefile` and can be customized if needed:

| Variable         | Description                                                                           | Default Value           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |

| `CONTAINER_NAME` | The name of the Docker container.                                                     | `next-js-app-container` |
| `HOST_PORT`      | The port on the host machine that the container will map to.                          | `3000`                  |
| `CONTAINER_PORT` | The port inside the Docker container where Nginx serves the application.              | `8080`                  |
| `DOCKERFILE`     | The Dockerfile to use.                                                                | `Dockerfile.export`     |

### Next.js Configuration

To configure the next.config.js file for different output options, use the following setup:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  // output: "standalone", // Use the Dockerfile.standalone file with this option
  output: "export",
};

export default nextConfig;
```

- **Standalone Mode**: Uncomment the line output: "standalone" if you want to use Dockerfile.standalone.
- **Export Mode**: By default, this configuration uses output: "export", which enables static export of the Next.js app.

---

### How to Build and run the project under Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

```bash
  make build
```

2.  **Run the Docker Container**:

```bash
  make run
```

3. **Build and Run with a Single Command**
   Alternatively, you can build and run in one step with:

```bash
 make build-run
```

---

## Deployment

This configuration is designed for deployment on environments where Docker is available. The Nginx server efficiently serves the static Next.js build, making it suitable for production use.

---

## Notes

- Ensure Docker is properly configured to allow external access to port `3000` on the host machine if necessary.
- Modify the Makefile variables as needed for custom image names, container names, and ports.

---

## Docker Compose with Watch Mode

This project supports watch mode for live reloading during development using Docker Compose. The docker-compose.yml file is configured to sync changes in your local project directory with the container and rebuild the service when key files change.

```bash
docker compose up --watch
```

**Watch Mode Configuration: The develop section in the docker-compose.yml file includes:**

- **Sync Changes**: Automatically syncs changes made in your local ./app directory with the /app directory inside the container. -**Rebuild Dependencies**: Automatically rebuilds the service when package.json changes, e.g., when you install a new package.
- **File Syncing**: Changes to source files will be reflected inside the container in real-time. However, the node_modules folder is excluded to improve performance.
